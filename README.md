## What Is Flash Loan Code

Flash loan code refers to smart contract logic that does the following:

1. Requests a flash loan from a liquidity provider  
2. Receives the borrowed assets  
3. Executes a trading or financial strategy  
4. Repays the flash loan plus fee  
5. Keeps the profit  

All of this happens inside one transaction. If any step fails, the blockchain reverts the entire operation.

CryptaLend flash loans can be used in any Solidity smart contract that supports ERC20 token transfers.

## CryptaLend Flash Loan Fees

CryptaLend uses a simple and predictable fee structure.

1. Loan size from 1,000 USD to 50,000 USD  
   Fee: 7 percent  

2. Loan size from 51,000 USD to 250,000 USD  
   Fee: 3 percent  

3. Loan size from 251,000 USD to 1,000,000 USD  
   Fee: 3 percent  

There is no collateral requirement and no risk of liquidation.

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is designed for four main user groups.

### 1. Arbitrage Traders and DeFi Strategists

These users run flash loan arbitrage across decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer.

They use flash loan code to:
1. Buy assets on one exchange
2. Sell them on another exchange
3. Repay the loan
4. Keep the price difference

---

### 2. Crypto Holders Seeking Liquidity

Some users use flash loans and crypto loans to access liquidity without selling their crypto holdings.

They borrow assets, deploy capital, and repay later while maintaining their market exposure.

---

### 3. Liquidity Providers and Yield Optimizers

Liquidity providers deposit assets into CryptaLend pools and earn fees whenever flash loan code is executed.

Higher trading volume leads to higher yield for lenders.

---

### 4. Smart Contract Developers

Developers use flash loan code to build:
1. Arbitrage bots
2. Liquidation engines
3. Collateral rebalancing systems
4. Automated trading strategies

## How Flash Loan Arbitrage Works

Flash loan arbitrage is based on price differences between decentralized exchanges.

Example workflow:

1. Borrow USDC using a CryptaLend flash loan  
2. Buy ETH on Uniswap where the price is lower  
3. Sell ETH on SushiSwap where the price is higher  
4. Repay the flash loan plus fee  
5. Keep the profit  

This logic is executed entirely by smart contract code.
